# SageList

SageList is a todolist web application with the most basic features of most web apps, i.e. accounts/login, API and (somewhat) interactive UI.

## Explore
Try it out by installing the requirements. (Works only with python >= 3.8, due to Django 4)

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Migrate:

    python manage.py migrate

And then start the server (default: http://localhost:8000)

    python manage.py runserver


# Future

We are working on making SageList standalone.

It will mostly be a repl-hosted link
